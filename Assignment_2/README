This assignmet contains two c programs, server.c and client.c

To compile and run this assginment:
Open a linux terminal in the project directory and type "make" command.

First the user needs to run the server.
For example use: sudo ./server 8082
( At first when I tried to run this command I got an error that the key was too small.
  In order to solve this I found on the internet that I need to change
  the parameter CipherString = DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=2 to DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=1
)

a. Why should you use the sudo command?
Because the server code cantained a function called "isRoot()" that checks if the user running this is root.

b. What is the number 8082?
It's the port number in which the server listens. 

Then the user should run the client in another terminal. 
For example: ./client 127.0.0.1 8082 (The port number needs to be the same as the one you entered on the server)

a. What is 127.0.0.1?
It's the address 

b. What is 8082?
It's the port number in which the server listens.
