This project is not complete.

First I initialized the valued I need to print later (about the total packets, network flow, tcp, udp etc.) and I created a main function that has the functionality we want, when given the correct arguments it is supposed to run another function. I only wrote one: packet_capture(output_file); that is supposed to capture the file and process the information from it. 

11. Can you tell if an incoming TCP packet is a retransmission? If yes, how? If not, why?
    In general you can tell if an incoming TCP packet is a retransmission if:
        - When the packet is not kept-alive
        - When payload > 0, or when flags SYN = 1 or FIN = 1
        - When the expected number of the sequence is greater than the sequence number of the packet

        in order to check this I created two structs: network_flow & tcp_packet but didn't complete the task. 

12. Can you tell if an incoming UDP packet is a retransmission? If yes, how? If not, why?
    No, the DCP Protocol does not retrasmit packets, so there is no possibility of a retransmission.
