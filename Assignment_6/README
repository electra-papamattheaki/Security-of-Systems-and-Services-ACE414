To run this program you use:
    chmod +x adblock.sh
And then:
    sudo ./adblock.sh -*whichever command you want*
Use -help for help.

I added for extra help these 3 variables: 
ip_tables="/sbin/iptables"
domainNamesSame="domainNamesSame.txt"
domainNamesDifferent="domainNamesDifferent.txt"

-domains:

I used 'fgrep -v -f' to get all the different domain names from the two files and stored them to $domainNamesDifferent 
and 'fgrep -f' to get all the same domain names stored them to $domainNamesSame. With a loop and 'dig +short' I got the 
IP addresses and stored them to $IPAddressesDifferent and $IPAddressesSame respectively.

-ipssame:

I used a loop that reads the file and "$ip_tables" -I INPUT -s $line -j DROP to drop all the packets from the same IPs.

-ipsdiff:

I used a loop that reads the file and "$ip_tables" -I INPUT -s $line -j REJECT to reject all the packets from the
different IPs.

-save:

In order to save the rules I used "$ip_tables"-save > $adblockRules

-load:

In order to load the rules I used "$ip_tables"-restore < $adblockRules

-reset:

In order to reset the rules I used "$ip_tables" -F that deletes all rules in  chain or all chains. 

-list:

In order to list all the rules I used "$ip_tables" -L 


So when I run:

    - sudo ./adblock.sh -domains
        I get the 2 files containing the IP addresses.
    - sudo ./adblock.sh -ipsdiff
    - sudo ./adblock.sh -list 
     It shows all the ip adressess that is supposed to REJECT.
    - sudo ./adblock.sh -ipssame
    - sudo ./adblock.sh -list  
        It shows all the ip adressess that is supposed to DROP and then REJECT.
    - sudo ./adblock.sh -save
        All the rules are saved in $adblockRules.
    - sudo ./adblock.sh -reset
        All the rules are reset.
    - sudo ./adblock.sh -load
        It loads all the previous rules.
    - sudo ./adblock.sh -list
        It shows all the rules I previously set.

Answer to Question 1:

After configuring the adblock rules test your script by visiting your favourite websites without any other 
adblocking mechanism, can you see ads? Do they load? Some ads persist, why?

Most of the ads are not loading but there are some that keep appearing.
